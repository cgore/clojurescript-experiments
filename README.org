These are my experiments learning ClojureScript.

- This uses Leiningen from http://leiningen.org/
- This uses cljs-kickoff from https://github.com/konrad-garus/cljs-kickoff

* 01-hello-alert

You can make the first project by:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
lein new cljs-kickoff hello-alert
mv hello-alert 01-hello-alert
#+END_SRC

You can't create the project directly with the directory name 01, because that
isn't a legitimate variable name in ClojureScript, but you can rename the
directory after the fact and it will work.

Running a server:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd 01-hello-alert
lein ring server
#+END_SRC

The first time through it will take a while to compile cljs.js, but it should
be under a minute overall, and then a server will be started.  The basic bare
ClojureScript app is a hello popup, which you can access via http://localhost:3001

* 02-digital-clock

This is a digital clock, showing the current time.
