These are my experiments learning ClojureScript.

You can make the first project by:

lein new cljs-kickoff hello-alert
mv hello-alert 01-hello-alert

Running a server:

cd 01-hello-alert
lein ring server

The first time through it will take a while to compile cljs.js, but it should
be under a minute overall, and then a server will be started.  The basic bare
ClojureScript app is a hello popup, which you can access via http://localhost:3001

This uses Leiningen from http://leiningen.org/
This uses cljs-kickoff from https://github.com/konrad-garus/cljs-kickoff
